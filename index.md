PhD student in Computer Science at Loyola University Chicago working on applied machine learning for medical imaging, with an emphasis on human-aligned image quality assessment and clinical validation.

## Research focus
- Medical imaging ML for image enhancement, denoising, and synthesis (CT/CBCT workflows)
- Human-aligned evaluation for image quality and clinical usability
- Interpretability and reliability assessment for clinical-facing ML

## Selected projects

### Bone-suppressed imaging for markerless lung tumor tracking
- Developed a deep learning model for bone-suppressed image synthesis to support markerless tracking.
- Trained and evaluated on **2,694 phantom** and **4,499 patient** image pairs from **20 lung SBRT patients**.
- Demonstrated tracking performance statistically equivalent to conventional bone-suppressed images (phantom: **93.5% success**, **0.22% false match rate**, **~1 mm error**; patient: median deviation **0.3 mm vs 0.5 mm**, **p < 0.01**).

### CNN-based model observer for human-aligned image quality assessment
- Built CNN-based model observers to predict **1–5 Likert** image-quality scores from CBCT slices.
- Dataset of **8,556 slices** from **23 head-and-neck patients**, rated by **5 expert observers** across multiple structures and overall quality.
- Achieved human-comparable agreement (best model: **QWK 0.76**, **MAE 0.39**, **W-1 98%**, with **≥93%** of predictions within one Likert category).

### Interpretability for clinical-facing ML (in progress)
- Studying interpretability and reliability assessment methods for clinical imaging ML.
- Quantifying attribution consistency and alignment with image quality using Grad-CAM-style maps
