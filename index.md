PhD student in Computer Science at Loyola University Chicago working on applied machine learning for medical imaging, with an emphasis on human-aligned image quality assessment and clinical validation.

## Research focus
- Medical imaging ML for image enhancement, denoising, and synthesis (CT/CBCT workflows)
- Human-aligned evaluation for image quality and clinical usability
- Interpretability and reliability assessment for clinical-facing ML

## Selected projects
**Bone-suppressed imaging for markerless lung tumor tracking**
- Developed a deep learning model for bone-suppressed image synthesis to support markerless tracking.
- Validated on phantom and patient imaging data; results reported in *Medical Physics* (2025).

**CNN-based model observer for image quality**
- Built CNN-based model observers to predict Likert-scale image quality scores from CBCT slices.
- Focused on human-aligned evaluation and clinically grounded validation for scalable assessment.

**Interpretability for clinical-facing ML (in progress)**
- Studying interpretability and reliability assessment methods for clinical imaging ML.
- Emphasis on evaluation practices that support trustworthy use in clinical workflows.
